## Step 1: Install Axios

To use Axios in your Node.js project, you need to install it using npm (Node Package Manager). Open your terminal and navigate to your project folder:

```shell
npm install axios
```

This command installs the Axios package, which allows you to make HTTP requests easily.

## Step 2: Write the Axios Code with a Callback Function

Now that Axios is installed, you can write code to make an HTTP GET request to 'https://www.google.com' and handle the response using a callback function. Here's the code:

```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

console.log("Before");

axios('https://www.google.com', callback);

function callback(err, data) {
    if (err) {
        console.log(err);
        return;
    }
    console.log(data);
}

console.log("After");
```

- `axios('https://www.google.com', callback);`: Initiates an HTTP GET request to 'https://www.google.com' using Axios and specifies a callback function (`callback`) to handle the response.

- `function callback(err, data) { ... }`: This is the callback function that takes two parameters, `err` and `data`. It is called when the HTTP request is complete.

- Inside the `callback` function:
  - If there is an error (`err` is not `null` or `undefined`), it logs the error to the console.
  - If there is no error, it logs the `data`, which would contain the response from the HTTP request.

- `console.log("After");`: This line is outside the callback and will execute immediately after the `axios` call, without waiting for the HTTP request to complete.

This code allows you to make an HTTP request and handle the response using a callback function, providing a callback-style pattern for handling asynchronous operations.

### Why this work?
The code you provided works because you're using the `axios` function in a way that takes advantage of its ability to return a Promise. Here's an explanation of how it works step by step:

1. `axios('https://www.google.com', callback);`: In this line, you're making an HTTP GET request to 'https://www.google.com' using `axios`. Instead of using `.then` to handle the response, you're passing a callback function (`callback`) as the second argument. This is a non-standard way of using `axios`, but it can work because `axios` returns a Promise.

2. `function callback(err, data) {...}`: This is your callback function, which takes two parameters, `err` and `data`. This function will be called when the HTTP request is complete.

3. Inside the `callback` function:
   - If there is an error (`err` is not `null` or `undefined`), you log the error to the console.
   - If there is no error, you log the `data`, which would contain the response from the HTTP request.

4. `console.log("After");`: This line is outside the callback and will execute immediately after the `axios` call, without waiting for the HTTP request to complete.

So, this code essentially initiates an HTTP GET request to 'https://www.google.com' using `axios` and specifies a callback function (`callback`) to handle the response. When the request completes (either successfully or with an error), the `callback` function is called, and it handles the result.

Please note that this approach is not the typical way to use `axios`, but it can work if you want to use a callback-style pattern rather than Promises or `async/await` for handling asynchronous operations.

### Certainly! Let's simplify the code by using `async/await` and a custom function to make the HTTP request and handle both success and error cases:

```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

console.log("Before");

async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get('https://www.google.com');
    // Successful request
    console.log('statusCode:', response.status);
    // You can access the HTML content using response.data
    return response; // Return the response on success
  } catch (error) {
    // Error handling
    console.error('error:', error);
    throw error; // Throw the error on failure
  }
}

async function main() {
  try {
    const response = await fetchData();
    // Do something with the response here
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle errors here
  }
}

main();

console.log("After");
```

In this simplified code:

1. We define an `async` function called `fetchData` that encapsulates the HTTP request logic using `axios` and handles both success and error cases.

2. The `main` function is also defined as an `async` function and calls `fetchData` to perform the request. You can handle the response and errors within the `main` function.

3. We use `await` to wait for asynchronous operations to complete, making the code more readable and avoiding the need for `.then`.

This code structure simplifies the handling of the HTTP request and its results, making it easier to understand and maintain.
